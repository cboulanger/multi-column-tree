# Multi Column Tree contrib
 
This is a comprehensive tree implementation with a variety of column types. 

## Installation

Currently, the widget requires a fork of qooxdoo to work, available at 

https://github.com/johnspackman/qooxdoo/tree/event-promises-2

which you can add to your qooxdoo repo clone using

```bash
git remote add jsqooxdoo https://github.com/johnspackman/qooxdoo.git
git fetch jsqooxdoo
git checkout -b event-promises-2 --track jsqooxdoo/event-promises-2
```

There will be a PR soon to integrate the changes into the master branch.

## Demos

In the project root dir, execute `qx serve` and then open http://localhost:8080 to see the available demos.
